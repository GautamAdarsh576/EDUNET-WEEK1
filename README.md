# 🌾 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project uses Machine Learning to recommend the best crop to grow and the most suitable fertilizer to use based on environmental and soil data such as temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy

## 📂 Files Included
- `Crop_Fertilizer_Recommendation.ipynb` - The Google Colab notebook with code and model.
- `Week1_Assessment.docx` - Word file explaining ML concepts and steps.
- `Dataset.csv` - Input data used for training and testing.

## 🔍 How to Use
1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Upload the dataset CSV file.
3. Run each cell to:
   - Import libraries
   - Load data
   - Explore dataset (using `head()`, `info()`)

## ✅ Outcome
A basic yet effective ML model to help farmers and agricultural experts make better crop and fertilizer choices using data-driven insights.
